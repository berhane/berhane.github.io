High Performance Computing
==========================

Advances in computer hardware and software algorithms over the recent
decades has made computer modeling an essential component of research
and discovery. Scientific modeling is now the third pillar of discovery
alongside laboratory/field experiments and theory. While many modeling
problems can be handeled by laptops, desktops and workstations, most
rigorous computations require more sheer computational power, faster
networking, larger storage, more memory, ... etc. When one's research
workflow encounters limits associated with any of these problems with
performance or throughput, it is time to look into high-performance
computing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) capabilities to
enable and accelate one's research. \
 \
 Over the last 10-15 years, the ability to build commodity HPC clusters
from generic components and run free, open source software (FOSS) has
made HPCs more affordable and it has expanded their use. The simplest
way to think of HPCs is as a bunch of individual computers, often
referred to as nodes, servers or blades, networked using a fast
interconnect, equipped with fast shared storage, and packaged into a
rack in such a way that they behave as a single, powerful computer. \
 \
 HPC resources and solutions are designed to have the following
capabilities:

-   **Massive parallelism** - Many enterprise-grade servers and
    processors tightly coupled to enable parallel performance
-   **Large shared-memory nodes** - lots of memory on every node/blade
-   **Parallel file systems** - fast and reliable storage system
-   **Fast networking** - GigaBit ethernet and Infiniband/Omnipath
    fabrics interconnecting nodes/blades to one another and the shared
    storage system
-   **Efficient data movement tools** - commandline and GUI tools for
    quickly transferring data
-   **Visualization capabilities** - tools to visualize data on the HPC
    instead of having to transfer it to a remote host first

Many faculty at CofC do research that is computationally demanding
enough to require an HPC resource. Some faculty already use HPC
resources and we have identified many others whose work and workflow are
good candidates for HPC/HTC. If you are interested in learning more
about HPC/HTC at CofC, please email [me](mailto:temelsob@cofc.edu). \
 To meet the HPC and HTC needs of researchers at CofC, we are working on
three solutions.

-   **An HPC cluster on campus** - on top of a small cluster we
    currently have, we plan to acquire another cluster soon
-   **NSF XSEDE resources**- we have computer time at XSEDE resources
    and the expertise to help some users get started
-   **Commercial cloud providers** - we are exploring free/inexpensive
    options to use Amazon AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for
    research purposes.

`New Campus HPC Cluster`

`NSF XSEDE`

`Commercial Cloud Platorms`

Commercial cloud providers are a reasonable option for the right kinds
of problems and workflows. They do require users to fund their own
usage. Researchers who find cloud resources indispensible, but lack
funding to use them can apply for educational grants.

-   Amazon AWS\

    [![AWS](https://d0.awsstatic.com/logos/powered-by-aws.png)](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/)
-   Google Cloud
-   Microsoft Azure

Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform are currently the
top three commercial cloud environments. They provide very similar
options to draw more people into their platforms by offering limited
free account for 12 months. However, Amazon AWS and Google GCP are the
only ones that have a clear program to grant credits on their platforms
for researchers. The application process varies, but it is safe to say
that it would take months between the time of application and credits’
availability. The credits granted are limited since they are mainly
intended for performing novel, proof of concept or benchmarking examples
that demonstrate the capabilities of doing HPC in the cloud. Therefore,
they are probably not an option for most conventional users. The
research grants/credits should be thought of as a supplement rather than
replacement of most researchers’ existing HPC capacity.

**Free for any use** - All three major cloud platforms provide a virtual
machine for any use like hosting websites and other light operations for
free for 12 months.

**Free for training and educational uses** - Amazon and Google have
programs to give faculty and students accounts for training and
workforce development for free. Microsoft treats its
training/educational program no differently than its standard free
service.

1.  Amazon -

2.  Google -

3.  Microsoft -

**Grants for research computing** - Amazon and Google have programs
where researchers can apply for grants in the form of credits on AWS or
GCP.

AWS Cloud Credits for Research -
[https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/?refid=gs\_card](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/?refid=gs_card)

1.  Awarded credits vary and will be for on-demand and Spot Instance EC2
    usage
2.  Submit proposal before four quarterly deadlines (March 31, June 30,
    September 30, and December 31.
3.  Decisions are typically communicated 2-3 months following the
    respective quarterly deadline)
4.  Awards are for a one-year term, and not eligible for renewal or
    extension

GCP Research Credits -
[https://lp.google-mkto.com/gcp-research-credits-FAQ.html](https://lp.google-mkto.com/gcp-research-credits-FAQ.html)

1.  \$5000 worth GCP credits for one year
2.  Application must include a one-page proposal
3.  The applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. It takes 4-6 weeks
    to review proposals and 60 days to make the credits available for
    use
4.  \$5000 is not a lot to do much HPC for most people, but it could be
    enough for some faculty or a good supplement to others.
