Research
========

`Hydrogen-bonded Molecular Clusters` Most of my research involves determining the structure and
property of molecular clusters held together by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for
giving water and biological molecules their unique structure and properites. However, developing a
water model that can describe all its unusual and crucial properties has proven difficult. We
predict the structure of small molecular clusters of pure water, small hydrates of atmosphereic
interest and complexes of water with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of astrophysical interest. In
collaboration with experimental colleagues, we examine the structure and stability of these
molecular clusters as well as the implications of our findings for atmospheric aerosol formation and
ability of extraterrestrial environments to sustain life.

Because these molecular clusters are held together by weak and dynamic hydrogen bonds, the kinds of structures they can form and their relative stability is very hard to determine. We develop and apply different tools to 1) sample the large number of configurations these clusters can adapt efficiently and 2) determine which ones are important. For example, we have applied the protocol below to systems ranging from water clusters and sulfate aerosols to small peptides.

`Structure Alignment` One of the challenges in studying molecular clusters is determining how similar or different isomers are. One recently developed resource is [**ArbAlign**](http://arbalign.org/) which is a web and command line tool to align any two isomers for accurately assessing their similarity.

`Molecular Cluster Repository` Another work under development is a [**Molecular Clusters Repository**](http://molecularclusters.xyz/) to compile and share published structures and energies of molecular clusters in a convenient way.
