*   Berhane Temelso is computer systems engineer at GMU. Prior to his start at GMU in August 2020, he was a senior HPC system adminstrator and research computing consultant at College of Charleston (CofC). He is a computational chemist by training and he has worked as a research scientist and HPC system adminsitrator with [George C. Shields](http://www2.furman.edu/academics/chemistry/faculty-and-staff/Pages/George-Shields.aspx) and [MERCURY consortium](http://mercuryconsortium.org) at Furman University, Bucknell University and Armstrong Atlantic University for many years prior to joining CofC. 

Dr. Temelso managed MERCURY consortium's HPC clusters named [Skylight](http://mercuryconsortium.org/skylight/) and [Marcy](http://mercuryconsortium.org/skylight/) as a system administrator.  He provided technical research support to MERCURY users and promoted the use of HPC in chemistry and other fields. In March 2017, he was also named an inaugural Foresight Institute Fellow in computational chemistry.

He received his Ph.D. in computational chemistry from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA and B.A. in physics from Berea College in Berea, KY. His Ph.D. work explored the ability of the most rigorous first-principles computational methods to reproduce molecular properties derived from experimpent.    

Dr. Temelso's research mainly focuses on the application of efficient computational methods to understand the structure and dynamics of hydrogen-bonded systems ranging from water clusters to atmospheric aerosols. He collaborates with experimental groups to solve interesting problems like the structure of small water clusters and the formation rates of sulfate atmospheric aerosols whose cooling effect on the global climate is significant, but poorly understood.
